# jira-cli-wrappers

> At work we are using [jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) for project management.
> It appears to have all the features that one would want for projects management, particular for software engineering type work (from what I understand at least). However I personally find both graphical (web) interface and cli rather clunky to use. I won't go into a full spill about here, but the fact that there are a few wrappers and re-writes of jira-cli exists out there confirms the point.
> Here I'm not doing anything special simply wrote a few BASH scripts that simplify a few essential commands that I'm using on a day to day basis.

## Install and usage
